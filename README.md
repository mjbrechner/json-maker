JSON Maker by M.J. Brechner

I created this app in order to help me create the JSON file for my Scots-English dictionary project at https://github.com/mjbrechner/scots-english.
With this app, I can quickly enter the dictionary data and copy the resulting file to be added to the actual dictionary JSON file.

Viewable at https://mjbrechner.github.io/json-maker/.
